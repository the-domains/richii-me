# Hand held at 300mm

I recently picked up the 70-300mm lens for my Nikon 1 system cameras - the nice man in the shop made me an offer too good to refuse! I gave it a bit of a workout at Perth Zoo, but the moon is always a good point of reference.

This shot is a jpeg straight out of the camera, no processing or cropping, taken hand-held at 300mm (approx 810mm equivalent on a 35mm frame). I'm sure a few minutes tweaking the raw file will look even better!
