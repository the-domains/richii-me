description: "The veteran British actor and filmmaker Alan Rickman has died at the age of 69. The much-loved figure's death was confirmed Thursday by his family. He had been suffering from cancer. Already a well-respected figure on the London stage during the 1980's, Rickman achieved global success as a film actor relatively late in life following his memorable turn as terrorist Hans Gruber in 1988's Die Hard opposite Bruce Willis."
